Dr Swarthout,

The TTC project is a simplified version of my experimental economics paper on toptrading cycle mechanism.
The current version has a complete logic, which is similar to the experiment design in my paper.
I'll attach my paper; the sample experiment instructions, treatments and dcision sheets are in the appendix.
It seems I cannot connect Heroku with GitHub anymore. I'm useing Heroku Git to deploy data but not sure if it works well.
Here are next steps:
1. Evenly assign participants to 5 types with different preference (payment) tables.
2. Figure out the matching algorithm. I have the previous ztree file (.ztt) in hand but have no idea how to use them.
3. A video explanation of the matching mechanism.
4. The experiment is supposed to be a mix of paper instructions: it can better explain the matching mechanism and students can check back the mechanism when they're making decisions on the computer;
   and a computer project: to collect data especially the chattting data, and get to the allocation result quickly.
