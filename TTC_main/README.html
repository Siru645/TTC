Dr. Swarthout,

The TTC project is a simplified version of my experimental economics paper on the top trading cycle mechanism.
The current version has a complete logic, which is similar to the experiment design in my paper.
I'll attach my paper; the sample experiment instructions, treatments and decicsion sheets are in the appendix.
The experiment requires 4 subjects doing it at the same time. So please open four links (e.g., P1,P2,P3,P4) to run the experiments.
Here are next steps:
1. Evenly assign participants to 5 types with different preference (payment) tables.
2. Figure out the matching algorithm in python.
3. A video explanation of the matching mechanism.
4. The experiment is supposed to be a mix of paper instructions and computer decision-making, so I didn't include all the information the subjects need to know in the code.
   The paper version instruction can better explain the matching mechanism and students can check back the mechanism when they're making decisions on the computer.
