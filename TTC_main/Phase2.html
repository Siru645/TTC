    Here is a piece of suggestion from an experienced school advisor:
    <br>
    This allocation method takes into account your preferences and the preferences of others in order to provide as many top choices as possible.
    You have more chance of getting matched with your desired schools if you rank them following you true preference.
    No matter what other subjects do, you are always better off by submitting true ranking lists.
    Hope you get matched with your preferred school!

</p>

<p>
    There are 20 students in this room (including you).
    In this experiment, twenty seats are available across three schools:
    school A with eight seats, school B with eight seats, and school C with four seats.
    You’ll get ${{Constants.paymentA}} if you’re matched with school A.
    You’ll get ${{Constants.paymentB}} if you’re matched with school B.
    You’ll get ${{Constants.paymentC}} if you’re matched with school C.
